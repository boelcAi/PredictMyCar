The application uses AI to calculate the required carpool size if all private cars are banned. 
<br/>
<br/>
Car sharing is a very good solution for saving resources. And with the use of AI, it is possible that everyone can still get a car when they need one. 
<br/>
<br/>
To show how many vehicles can be saved by creating carpools, people are first generated and listed by the computer, according to statistical specifications.

<br/>
<br/>
Then, their vehicle needs, spread over the whole day (24 hours), are predicted by a deep artificial intelligence.

<br/>
<br/>
Based on the AI forecast, the necessary size of the carpool is determined (for each hour) and the vehicle savings are shown pictorially
